# CS385: Mobile Application Development

This was a group project involving 4 participants for our 3rd year mobile application development module in Maynooth University.
The application found under the "FinalApp" folder is an AndroidSDK app coded using Android Studio.
The application is a game named "Notice Me Sensei", a game parodying visual novel style games in which the player plays as a computer science students attending classes for 5 days.
Each morning the student must decide whether to go to class or stay at home. 
If the student attends class, they will learn some basic Java from the dialogue and be able to revise the dialogue in the notes each day.
On the final day, the student must take a quiz on the content from the classes.
Based on their score in the quiz and the overall attendence of the student, the teacher will then decide whether or not to act as a reference for the student's CV.
